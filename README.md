# IpFilter - IP Address region Filtering for Apache

Provides a very simple, yet effective way of filtering access to a PHP-enabled Apache web server, from a customizable set of CIDR addresses
stored on MySQL databases. Clients are filtered before the request is actually served, using the `auto_prepend_file` php setting, transparently
to other resources on the server.

Once a request is received by the server, the filtering server kicks in and compares the source address against a defined set of CIDR ranges from
the database, if a match is found, the result is cached and the connection is closed without further forwarding. Analytics data is generated and stored
on the database for further analisis.

Also includes a simple Wordpress plugin for viewing filtering statistics and top offenders.

This script is intended for reducing traffic impact on servers from selected regions, but could also be used to restrict access to the server selectively.

> Note that the effectiveness of the driver is directly related to the quality of its filters.


## Requirements
- MySQL/MariaDB (tested with 15)
- Apache2 with PHP >= 7.0
- Ability to set `auto_prepend_file` for the server
- GeoIP Database generation utility from [nro-geoip](https://github.com/KDERazorback/nro_geoip/releases)

## Prerequisites
- Download the NROIpDbGen tool binaries from [nro-geoip](https://github.com/KDERazorback/nro_geoip) repository, or optionally compile it from source.


## GeoIP Database Compilation
- Create a new empty database schema for the GeoIP tables on the host where MySQL/MariaDB is running, with its own username, initially with remote access granted.
- Run the NRODbGen tool without arguments. This will output a new answers file from its templates into the current directory.
    - _This file is used to configure the behaviour of the NRODbGen tool._
- Tweak the generated answers file to suit your needs. Be sure to insert the Server credentials and database details for remote database access.
    - Its recommended to also save the GeoIP schema to an SQL file on disk to avoid requesting it again from the NRO servers.
- Run the NRODbGen tool to populate the geoip table on the remote host with the latest IP allocation data from global NROs. Specifying the answers file with the following syntax:
    `nrodbgen.exe /answers=answers_file.txt`


## Driver installation
- Create a new empty database schema for the driver tables on the host where the driver will be running, with its own username, with local access only.
- From the `public` directory, be sure to edit the following files, updating the database configurations and tweaking as needed:
    - `ipfilter/config.php`
    - `ipfilter/setup/config_setup.php` _(only used during setup)_
- Move the entire `ipfilter` directory from the `public` folder, as well as the `filter.php` file into the root of your web server.
- Browse to the `/ipfilter/setup/` directory of your web server using the browser of your choice.
- Once the installation succeeds. Edit your php.ini file and add the following entry:
    `auto_prepend_file   <path to the filter.php file on your web directory>`
- Once confirmed the server is loading the filter plugin normally, remove the `setup` directory and the `setup.php` file on the root of the server.


## Administration interface
1. Upload the management plugin `rz-ipfilter-manager` zip file into your Wordpress installation via the Add Plugin menu on the Administration Dashboard.
2. Activate the uploaded plugin.
3. Under the new IPFilter tab on the sidebar for the Administration Dashboard of Wordpress, select the Settings submenu, and update the database settings to
   the new Database schema created on the previous step. Save the settings.
4. Browse the IPFilter and Top Entries submenus and ensure that no connection errors appear when clicking on Refresh.


## Validate configuration
1. No PHP output must be generated by the filtering driver (`/filter.php`) during normal browsing.
2. Ensure that the "X-RZ-Floodgate" header is present on the HTTP response from the first query issued to server. 
    - A value of 0 means that the current IP is allowed, a value of 1 means its filtered.
    - This header could be ommited from the response if the Wordpress engine clears the Headers structure after loading, to avoid this, make sure to test its presence by browsing
      to an static resource like an image, css script, etc.
3. Ensure that your browsing IP is present on the cache table for ipfilter. Every unique visitor must be listed on this table, and a value on the **filtered** column indicates if
   the browsing address is filtered by the driver or not.
4. If another auto_prepend_file was present on the PHP configuration before installing the IPFilter driver, check that chainloading works by making sure its 
   execution still happens after the driver runs.
